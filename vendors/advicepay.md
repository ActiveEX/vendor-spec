- **Square:** General payment processor (no compliance oversight)
- **PayPal:** General payment processor (no compliance features)

### Use Cases

#### Ideal For:

#### Not Ideal For:

- **Solo Advisors with <10 Clients:** Essential tier may be overkill for very small practices
- **Non-Financial Planning Firms:** Not suitable for other industries or general invoicing
- **Budget-Conscious Firms:** Transaction fees can add up significantly
- **Firms Needing General Invoicing:** Not designed for general business invoicing
- **Very Small Teams (<3 clients):** May find simpler/cheaper alternatives more suitable
- **Firms Not Offering Compliance-Supported Planning:** If compliance oversight isn't needed
