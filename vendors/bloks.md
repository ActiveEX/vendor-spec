## Evaluation Notes

### Strengths

1. **No Meeting Bots Required** — Runs locally on your device with studio-grade recording quality, eliminating the awkwardness and privacy concerns of visible AI bots joining calls
2. **Self-Organizing Knowledge Base** — Automatically maps all conversations, emails, documents, and web data to people and companies without manual tagging or sorting
3. **Relationship Intelligence Focus** — Goes beyond basic transcription to build 360° People Briefs and Company Snapshots that provide pre-meeting context and historical tracking
4. **Data Ownership & Privacy** — Master knowledge base stays in your tenant (never used for AI training), with SOC2 certification and FINRA/SEC compliance for regulated industries
5. **CRM-Ready with See-Before-Sync** — One-click push to major CRMs (Salesforce, Affinity, Wealthbox, HubSpot, Dynamics) with preview of all changes before applying
6. **Ask Bloks Natural Language Search** — Query entire relationship graph in plain English ("Who did I promise to follow up with?" or "What was that Toronto conference?")
7. **Multi-Platform Coverage** — Captures Zoom, Teams, Meet, Slack, Webex, plus in-person meetings via iOS/Android mobile app
8. **Customizable Templates** — Both meeting summaries and company profile templates shareable across teams for consistent workflows
9. **Multi-Lingual Support** — Transcription and summaries in multiple languages out of the box

### Weaknesses

1. **Limited Meeting Platform Support** — No explicit support for GoToMeeting, BlueJeans, Cisco Webex (older), or niche platforms; primarily focused on Zoom/Teams/Meet/Slack/Webex
2. **CRM Integration Limitations** — Only 5 supported CRMs (Salesforce, Affinity, Wealthbox, HubSpot beta, Dynamics 365); no integrations for Redtail, Orion, Tamarac, or many RIA-specific CRMs
3. **Price Point for Individuals** — $69/month (annual) or $89/month is significantly higher than competitors like Fireflies ($10/month) or Otter.ai ($8.33/month)
4. **No Free Tier After Trial** — 7-day trial converts to paid subscription; no ongoing free tier for casual users or small teams testing adoption
5. **Data Enrichment Maturity** — User reviews note that AI-generated briefs can miss key professional history (e.g., 24 years at IBM not mentioned in initial brief), suggesting training/maturity needed
6. **HubSpot Integration in Beta** — One of the most widely-used CRMs still in beta integration status

### Use Cases

**Ideal For:**

- **Client-Facing Professionals** — Financial advisors, wealth managers, consultants, executive coaches who manage high-value, long-term relationships
- **Regulated Industries** — Financial services (FINRA/SEC), healthcare, legal where compliance, audit trails, and data residency requirements exist
- **Relationship-Driven Sales** — VCs, private equity, business development teams tracking complex stakeholder networks and deal history
- **Teams Needing CRM Hygiene** — Organizations struggling with CRM adoption or data quality, where auto-sync and see-before-sync reduce manual work
- **Professionals Managing 50-200+ Relationships** — Sweet spot where manual tracking breaks down but enterprise tools are overkill

**Not Ideal For:**

- **Transactional Sales Teams** — High-volume, short sales cycles where basic transcription (Fireflies, Otter) and simple CRM logging suffice
- **Budget-Conscious Individuals** — Solo practitioners or small teams where $69-89/month/user exceeds ROI compared to $10-20/month alternatives
- **Teams Using Niche CRMs** — RIAs using Redtail, Tamarac, Orion, or advisors using Junxure, Practifi where no native integration exists (manual workarounds required)
- **Public-Facing Support Teams** — Customer support, call centers needing real-time coaching, sentiment analysis, or quality assurance (tools like Gong/Chorus better suited)
- **Async/Email-Only Teams** — Organizations where most relationship context lives in email threads or project management tools rather than live conversations

### Key Differentiators

1. **Local Recording with No Meeting Bots** — Unlike Fireflies, Grain, or Fathom that send visible bots into meetings, Bloks runs locally with auto-detect, preserving privacy and avoiding client discomfort
2. **Relationship Graph Architecture** — Not just a meeting transcription tool; builds a self-organizing knowledge base that maps all signals (calls, emails, docs, web data) to people/companies
3. **"Ask Bloks" Relationship ChatGPT** — Natural language search across entire relationship history, not just individual meeting transcripts (competitive advantage vs. Otter, Fireflies)
4. **Data Ownership Model** — Master knowledge base stays in customer tenant, then syncs to CRM; exit strategy built-in (if you leave CRM, your data stays intact in Bloks)
5. **Compliance-First Design** — SOC2, FINRA/SEC, audit trail (Enterprise), and data residency options make it viable for regulated industries where most competitors fall short
