### Cons
- **Industry Lock-In:** Highly specialized for financial services - not suitable for other industries
- **Limited Public API Documentation:** API details not publicly available, barrier for custom development evaluation
- **Launch Plan Restrictions:** 5-user maximum severely limits small growing teams
- **Add-On Pricing Complexity:** Imaging and Speak only available in Growth+ (significant price jump from Launch)
- **Integration Details Scarce:** Full integration list and specifications not publicly documented
- **Support Documentation Access:** Most helpful documentation behind login wall
- **Broker-Dealer Approval:** Speak (texting) requires BD approval, limiting immediate usability for some users
- **Orion Ownership:** While beneficial for Orion users, may create conflicts for firms using competing portfolio systems

### Alternatives
- **Salesforce Financial Services Cloud:** More customizable, broader ecosystem, but steeper learning curve
- **Wealthbox:** Modern interface, simpler pricing, smaller feature set
- **Junxure:** Deep financial services focus, more customization options
- **Practifi:** Modern platform, good for RIAs, strong workflow engine
- **Advisors Assistant:** Comprehensive but dated interface
- **SmartOffice (SS&C):** Enterprise-grade for broker-dealers
- **Microsoft Dynamics 365:** General CRM with financial services add-ons

### Use Cases

#### Ideal For:
- **Independent RIAs** (5+ advisors) looking for comprehensive CRM with compliance built-in
- **Broker-Dealers** needing centralized supervision and multi-office management
- **Orion Users** seeking native CRM integration with portfolio management
- **Firms Prioritizing Compliance** with SEC/FINRA archiving and audit trail requirements
- **Teams Needing Workflow Automation** for client onboarding, reviews, and service processes
- **Advisory Firms Going Paperless** with integrated document management needs
- **Teams Wanting Compliant Texting** (where BD-approved)

#### Not Ideal For:
- **Solo Advisors** (1-2 users) who may find Launch plan sufficient but Growth plan expensive
- **Non-Financial Services Firms** (platform is industry-specific)
- **Firms Needing Extensive Customization** (less flexible than Salesforce)
- **Development Teams Without API Access** (public documentation limited)
- **Firms Using Non-Orion Portfolio Systems** as primary (potential integration conflicts)
- **Very Small Teams (<5 users) on Tight Budgets** (alternative platforms may be more cost-effective)

### Key Differentiators
1. **Compliance-First Design:** Built for SEC/FINRA from ground up, not retrofitted
2. **Orion Ecosystem Integration:** Seamless portfolio management + CRM for Orion users
3. **Bundled Communication Tools:** Texting (Speak) + Email archiving integrated in Growth plan
4. **Workflow Focus:** Strong process automation praised in user testimonials
5. **Financial Services Specificity:** Industry terminology, workflows, and integrations native to advisory business
