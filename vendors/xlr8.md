### Cons (6+ items)
1. **No Free Trial:** Cannot evaluate system hands-on before annual commitment
2. **Annual Commitment Required:** Must commit to full year even with monthly payment option, reducing flexibility
3. **One-Time Transition Cost:** Implementation project cost varies and can be substantial depending on firm complexity, data migration needs, and customizations
4. **Salesforce Learning Curve:** Requires learning Salesforce platform concepts and navigation; may be overwhelming for teams without CRM experience
5. **Higher Price Point for Small Firms:** At $80/user/month, may be expensive for very small firms or solo advisors compared to alternatives like Redtail or Wealthbox
6. **Customization May Require Consulting:** Advanced customizations beyond standard configuration may require paid consulting services
7. **Integration Details Not Publicly Documented:** Specific integration capabilities require demo/SOW meeting to fully understand

### Alternatives (with brief comparisons)

2. **Salentica Elements:** Salesforce overlay with Microsoft Dynamics option; strong workflow engine using Salesforce flows; slightly more complex but powerful automation capabilities
3. **Redtail CRM:** Purpose-built for financial advisors, significantly lower cost (~$99-$129/user/month), extensive integrations, but less customizable and lacks Salesforce platform power
4. **Wealthbox:** Simpler, more affordable CRM (~$35-$50/user/month), intuitive interface, but basic features and limited customization compared to XLR8
5. **QUIVR:** Newer Salesforce overlay with modern approach, focusing on client service and integrations; emerging competitor with similar positioning to XLR8
6. **Salesforce Financial Services Cloud:** Direct Salesforce implementation with financial services features; more expensive and requires dedicated Salesforce administrator/developer
